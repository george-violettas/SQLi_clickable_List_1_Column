# SQLi_clickable_List_1_Column
Full project with SQLi (dbHelper.java) and a clickable ArrayList. The ArrayList has only one columns, so the students need to download and understand how the other projects work with multiple columns. Then implement the multiple columns in this project. Right now the ArrayList is clickable. If a user clicks on an item, a Toast message appears. The student needs to implement a pop-up message asking the user if they really want to delete this record. If yes, the record should be deleted from the database.
